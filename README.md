Minimize thickness of a PLA L-Bracket

This code creates a GUI that accepts a wide range of inputs to incrementally decrease the diameter while maintaining an adequate factor of saftey
based upon Von Mises Theory. The user can then select which factor of saftey they wish to oberserve while the rest of the data is stored in a new .txt
folder.
