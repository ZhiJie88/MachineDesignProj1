Minimize thickness of a PLA L-Bracket

This code creates a GUI that accepts a wide range of inputs to incrementally decrease the inner diameter of an LBracket while maintaining an adequate factor of saftey based upon Von Mises Theory. The user can then select which factor of saftey they wish to oberserve while the rest of the data is stored in a new .txt file along side all computed data and an estimated weight [g].
